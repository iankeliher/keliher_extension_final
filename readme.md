#EXPLORE MULTIPLE COOPER UNION TIMELINES

###There are two different timelines:
*Cats
*Evil

The timeline "Cats" consists of a world in which all people have been replaced by (possibly sleepy) felines.
The timeline "Evil" is an exploration of the Darkest Timeline, a place where possible dark events have been taken forward.

######note: the Darkest Timeline is different from typical "bizarro-world" type scenarios of an inversion of reality. The Darkest Timeline makes it darker. There's a difference. Trust me.
