#EXPLORE MULTIPLE COOPER UNION TIMELINES

###There are two different timelines:
* **Cats**
* **Evil**

The timeline **Cats** consists of a world in which all people have been replaced by (possibly sleepy) felines.
The timeline **Evil** is an exploration of the Darkest Timeline, a place where possible dark events have been taken forward.

######note: the Darkest Timeline is different from typical "bizarro-world" type scenarios of an inversion of reality. The Darkest Timeline makes it darker. There's a difference. Trust me.

###Using the Chrome Extension:
* After loading extension, go to cooper.edu
* The interface of the Cooper Union homepage has been altered; this is what it's like:
	* The topmost menu has been transformed to include options for timelines **Cats** and **Evil** 
	* The lower, main menu has been transformed to include:
		* **About** tab which holds a NYT article about the financial crisis, the FreeCooper homepage, and the Way Forward Plan.
		* **FreeCooper Feed** section which contains the most recent 8 tweets from the Twitter API with search terms FreeCooper.
		* **History** tab includes a link to the Cooper Union wiki and a Peter Cooper bio.
		* The **Stuff to Look** At tab includes a link to whycooper.org.
	* After clicking one of the timeline options
